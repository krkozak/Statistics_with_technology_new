# Estimation

In hypothesis tests, the purpose was to make a decision about a parameter, in terms of it being greater than, less than, or not equal to a value. But what if you want to actually know what the parameter is. You need to do estimation. There are two types of estimation -- point estimator and confidence interval. The American Statistical Association (ASA) is recommending that confidence intervals are the process that should be followed when analyzing data.

## Basics of Confidence Intervals

A point estimator is just the statistic that you have calculated previously. As an example, when you wanted to estimate the population mean, $\mu$, the point estimator is the sample mean, $\bar{x}$. To estimate the population proportion, *p*, you use the sample proportion, $\hat{p}$. In general, if you want to estimate any population parameter, we will call it $\theta$, you use the sample statistic, $\hat{\theta}$.

Point estimators are really easy to find, but they have some drawbacks. First, if you have a large sample size, then the estimate is better. But with a point estimator, you don't know what the sample size is. Also, you don't know how accurate the estimate is. Both of these problems are solved with a confidence interval.

**Confidence interval:** This is where you have an interval surrounding your parameter, and the interval has a chance of being a true statement. In general, a confidence interval looks like: $\hat{\theta}\pm E$, where $\hat{\theta}$ is the point estimator and *E* is the margin of error term that is added and subtracted from the point estimator. Thus making an interval.

**Interpreting a confidence interval: **

The statistical interpretation is that the confidence interval has a probability $C=(1-\alpha)$ (where $\alpha$ is the complement of the confidence level) of containing the population parameter. As an example, if you have a 95% confidence interval of $0.65 < p < 0.73$, then you would say, "you are 95% confident that the interval 0.65 to 0.73 contains the true population proportion." This means that if you have 100 intervals, 95 of them will contain the true proportion, and 5 will not. The wrong interpretation is that there is a 95% confidence that the true value of *p* will fall between 0.65 and 0.73. The reason that this interpretation is wrong is that the true value is fixed out there somewhere. You are trying to capture it with this interval. So this is the chance that your interval captures it, and not that the true value falls in the interval.

There is also a real world interpretation that depends on the situation. It is where you are telling people what numbers you found the parameter to lie between. So your real world is where you tell what values your parameter is between. There is no probability attached to this statement. That probability is in the statistical interpretation.

The common probabilities used for confidence intervals are 90%, 95%, and 99%. These are known as the confidence level. The confidence level and the alpha level are related. If you are conducting a hypothesis test with $H_a:\mu\ne \mu_o$, then the confidence level is $C=1-\alpha$. This is because the $\alpha$ is both tails and the confidence level is area between the two tails. As an example, for a hypothesis test $H_a:\mu\ne \mu_o$ with $\alpha$ equal to 0.10, the confidence level would be 0.90 or 90%. If you have a hypothesis test with $H_a:\mu<\mu_o$, then your $\alpha$ is only one tail of the curve. Because of symmetry the other tail is also $\alpha$. You have $2\alpha$ with both tails. So the confidence level, which is the area between the two tails, is $C-2\alpha$.

### Example: Stating the Statistical and Real World Interpretations for a Confidence Interval

a. Suppose you have a 95% confidence interval for the mean age a woman gets married in 2013 is $26<\mu<28$. State the statistical and real world interpretations of this statement.

**Solution:**

 Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that the interval contains the mean age in 2013 that a woman gets married.

 Real World Interpretation: The mean age that a woman married in 2013 is between 26 and 28 years of age.

b. Suppose a 99% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who have tried marijuana as of 2013 is $0.35<p<0.41$. State the statistical and real world interpretations of this statement.

**Solution:**

 Statistical Interpretation: You are 99% confident that the interval contains the proportion of Americans who have tried marijuana as of 2013.

 Real World Interpretation: The proportion of Americans who have tried marijuana as of 2013 is between 0.35 and 0.41.

One last thing to know about confidence is how the sample size and confidence level affect how wide the interval is. The following discussion demonstrates what happens to the width of the interval as you get more confident.

Think about shooting an arrow into the target. Suppose you are really good at that and that you have a 90% chance of hitting the bull's eye. Now the bull's eye is very small. Since you hit the bull's eye
approximately 90% of the time, then you probably hit inside the next ring out 95% of the time. You have a better chance of doing this, but the circle is bigger. You probably have a 99% chance of hitting the target, but that is a much bigger circle to hit. You can see, as your confidence in hitting the target increases, the circle you hit gets bigger. The same is true for confidence intervals. This is demonstrated in figure \#8.1.1.

```{r, include=FALSE, fig.alt="Graph showing that 90% confident interval is narrower than a 95% confident interval, which is narrower than a 99% confidence interval"}
knitr::include_graphics("effect_confidence_level.png")
```


The higher level of confidence makes a wider interval. There's a trade off between width and confidence level. You can be really confident about your answer but your answer will not be very precise. Or you can have a precise answer (small margin of error) but not be very confident about your answer.

Now look at how the sample size affects the size of the interval. Suppose figure \#8.1.2 represents confidence intervals calculated on a 95% interval. A larger sample size from a representative sample makes the width of the interval narrower. This makes sense. Large samples are closer to the true population so the point estimate is pretty close to the true value.

```{r, include=FALSE, fig.alt="Graph showing that a confident interval created with a sample size of 30 is wider than a confident interval created with a sample size of 100, which is wider than a confidence interval created with a sample size of 1000."}
knitr::include_graphics("effect_sample_size.png")
```



Now you know everything you need to know about confidence intervals except for the actual formula. The formula depends on which parameter you are trying to estimate. With different situations you will be given the confidence interval for that parameter.

## One-Sample Interval for the Proportion

Suppose you want to estimate the population proportion, *p*. As an example you may be curious what proportion of students at your school smoke. Or you could wonder what is the proportion of accidents caused by teenage drivers who do not have a drivers' education class. 

**Confidence Interval for One Population Proportion (1-Prop Interval)**

1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.

 *x* = number of successes

 *p* = proportion of successes

2.  State and check the assumptions for the confidence interval

a.  A simple random sample of size *n* is taken.

b.  The condition for the binomial distribution are satisfied

  c.  The sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ can be approximated by a normal distributed. To determine the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is normally distributed, you need to show that $n*\hat{p}\ge5$ and , $n*\hat{q}\ge5$ where $\hat{q}=1-\hat{p}$. If this requirement is true, then the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is well approximated by a normal curve. (In reality this is not really true, since the correct assumption deals with *p*. However, in a confidence interval you do not know *p*, so you must use $\hat{p}$.)

3.  Find the sample statistic and the confidence interval

This will be conducted using R Studio. The command is 

```r
prop.test(r, n, conf.Level=C as a decimal)
```


4.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, "you are C% confident that $\hat{p}\pm E$ contains the true proportion."

5.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval contains the true proportion.

### Example: Confidence Interval for the Population Proportion

A concern was raised in Australia that the percentage of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners was higher than the percent of deaths of non-Aboriginal prisoners, which is 0.27%. A sample of six years (1990-1995) of data was collected, and it was found that out of 14,495 Aboriginal prisoners, 51 died (\"Indigenous deaths in,\" 1996). Find a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who died.

 **Solution:**

1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.

 *x* = number of Aboriginal prisoners who die

 *p* = proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who die

2.  State and check the assumptions for the confidence interval

a.  A simple random sample of 14,495 Aboriginal prisoners was taken. Check: The sample was not a random sample, since it was data from six years. It is the numbers for all prisoners in these six years, but the six years were not picked at random. Unless there was something special about the six years that were chosen, the sample is probably a representative sample. This assumption is probably met.

b.  The properties of the binomial experiment have been met. Check: There are 14,495 prisoners in this case. The prisoners are all Aboriginals, so you are not mixing Aboriginal with non-Aboriginal prisoners. There are only two outcomes, either the prisoner dies or doesn't. The chance that one prisoner dies over another may not be constant, but if you consider all prisoners the same, then it may be close to the same probability. Thus the properties of the binomial experiment are satisfied

c.  The sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ can be approximated with a normal distribution. Check: $\hat{p}*n=\frac{51}{14495}*14495=51\ge5$ and $\hat{q}*n=\frac{14495-51}{14495}*14495=14444\ge5$. The sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ can be approximated with a normal distribution.

3.  Find the sample statistic and the confidence interval

The command in R Studio for a confidence interval for a proportion is 

```{r prop-test8}
prop.test(51,14495, conf.level = 0.95)
```

 the 95% confidence level is $0.002647440<p<0.004661881$.

4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that the interval $0.0026<p<0.0047$ contains the proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who have died in prison.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who died in prison is between 0.26% and 0.47%.

### Example: Confidence Interval for the Population Proportion

A researcher who is studying the effects of income levels on breastfeeding of infants hypothesizes that countries with a low income level have a different rate of infant breastfeeding than higher income countries. It is known that in Germany, considered a high-income country by the World Bank, 22% of all babies are breastfeed. In Tajikistan, considered a low-income country by the World Bank, researchers found that in a random sample of 500 new mothers that 125 were breastfeeding their infant. Find a 90% confidence interval of the proportion of mothers in low-income countries who breastfeed their infants?

 **Solution:**

1.  State you random variable and the parameter in words.

 *x* = number of woman who breastfeed in a low-income country

 *p* = proportion of woman who breastfeed in a low-income country

2.  State and check the assumptions for the confidence interval

a.  A simple random sample of 500 breastfeeding habits of woman in a low-income country was taken. Check: This was stated in the problem.

b.  The properties of a Binomial Experiment have been met. check: There were 500 women in the study. The women are considered identical, though they probably have some differences. There are only two outcomes, either the woman breastfeeds or she doesn't. The probability of a woman breastfeeding is probably not the same for each woman, but it is probably not very different for each woman. The conditions for the binomial distribution are satisfied

c.  The sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ can be approximated with a normal distributed. Check:$n*\hat{p}= 500*\frac{125}{500}=125\ge5$ and $n*\hat{q}=500*\frac{500-125}{500}=375\ge5$, so the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is well approximated by a normal distribution.

4.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval

On R studio, use the following command

```{r prop-test8a}
prop.test(125, 500, conf.level = .90)
```
 90% confidence interval for p is $0.2185980<p<0.2841772$.

4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 90% confident that $0.2185980<p<0.2841772$ contains the     proportion of women in low-income countries who breastfeed their infants.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The proportion of women in low-income countries who breastfeed their infants is between 0.219 and 0.284.

### Homework

**In each problem show all steps of the confidence interval. If some of the assumptions are not met, note that the results of the interval may not be correct and then continue the process of the confidence interval.**

## One-Sample Interval for the Mean

Suppose you want to estimate the mean height of Americans, or you want to estimate the mean salary of college graduates. A confidence interval for the mean would be the way to estimate these means.

**Confidence Interval for One Population Mean (t-Interval)**

1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.

 x = random variable

 $\mu$ = mean of random variable

2.  State and check the assumptions for the confidence interval

a.  A random sample of size *n* is taken.

b.  The population of the random variable is normally distributed, though the t-test is fairly robust to the assumption if the sample size is large. This means that if this assumption isn't met, but your sample size is quite large, then the results of the t-test are valid.

3.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval

Use R Studio to find the confidence interval. The command is 

```r
t.test(~variable, data= Data Frame, conf.level=C as a decimal)
```


 4.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, "You are C% confident that the interval contains the true mean."

5.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval contains the true mean. 

**How to check the assumptions of confidence interval:**

In order for the confidence interval to be valid, the assumptions of the test must be true. Whenever you run a confidence interval, you must make sure the assumptions are true. You need to check them. Here is how you do this:

1.  For the assumption that the sample is a random sample, describe how you took the sample. Make sure your sampling technique is random.

2.  For the assumption that population is normal, remember the process of assessing normality from chapter 6.

### Example: Confidence Interval for the Population Mean

A random sample of 50 body mass index (BMI) were taken from the NHANES Data frame. Estimate the mean BMI of Americans at the 95% level.

**Table \#8.3.1: BMI of Americans**

```{r HHANES-50-sample8}
sample_NHANES_50<-
  sample_n(NHANES, size=50)
head(sample_NHANES_50)
```
 **Solution:**

1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.

 *x* = BMI of an American

 $\mu$ = mean BMI of Americans

2.  State and check the assumptions for the confidence interval

a.  A random sample of 50 BMI levels was taken. Check: A random sample was taken from the NHANES data frame using R Studio

b.  The population of BMI levels is normally distributed. Check:

(ref:sample-NHANES8-density-cap) Density Plot of BMI from NHANES sample

```{r sample-NHANES8-density, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:sample-NHANES8-density-cap)", fig.alt="Density plot of BMI. Looks somewhat skewed right"}
gf_density(~BMI, data=sample_NHANES_50, title="BMI of an American")
```

(ref:sample-NHANES8-qq-cap) Normal Quantile Plot of BMI from NHANES sample

```{r sample-NHANES8-qq, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:sample-NHANES8-qq-cap)", fig.alt="Normal quantile plot of BMI. Looks somewhat linear"}
gf_qq(~BMI, data=sample_NHANES_50, title="BMI of an American")
```


The density plot looks somewhat skewed right and the normal quantile plot looks somewhat linear. However, there doesn't seem to be strong evidence that the sample comes from a population that is normally distributed. However, since the sample is moderate to large, the t-test is robust to this assumption not being met. So the results of the test are probably valid.

4.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval
 
 On R Studio, the command would be

```{r t-test8}
t.test(~BMI, data= sample_NHANES_50, conf.level=0.95)
```
 The sample statistic is the mean of x in the output, and confidence interval is under the words 95 percent confidence interval.

4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that $24.87190<\mu<28.71422$ contains the mean BMI of Americans.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean BMI of Americans is between 24.87 and 28.71 $kg/m^2$.

Notice that in example \#7.3.2, you were asked if the mean BMI of Americans was different from Australians' mean BMI of 27.2 $kg/m^2$. The interval that example \#8.3.1 calculated does contain the value of 27.2. So you can't say that Americans' mean BMI and Australians' mean BMI are different.This means that you can just use confidence intervals and not conduct hypothesis tests at all if you prefer. 

### Example: Confidence Interval for the Population Mean

The data in table \#8.3.2 are the life expectancies for all people in European countries (\"WHO life expectancy,\" 2013). Table \#8.3.3 filtered the data frame for just males and just year 2000. The year 2000 was randomly chosen as the year to use. Estimate the mean life expectancy for a man in Europe at the 99% level.

**Table \#8.3.2: Life Expectancies for European Countries**

```{r expactancy8-data}
Expectancy<-read.csv(
  "https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/Life_expectancy_Europe.csv")
head(Expectancy)
```

**Table \#8.3.3: Life Expectancies of males in European Countries in 2000**

```{r expecantacy8-male-data}
Expectancy_male<-
  Expectancy%>%
  filter(sex=="Male", year=="2000")
head(Expectancy_male)
```
**Code book for data frame Expectancy** See example 7.3.3 in Section 7.3

**Solution:**

1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.

 *x* = life expectancy for a European man

 $\mu$ = mean life expectancy for European men

2.  State and check the assumptions for the confidence interval

a.  A random sample of 53 life expectancies of European men in 2000 was taken. Check: The data is actually all of the life expectancies for every country that is considered part of Europe by the World Health Organization in the year 2000. Since the year 2000 was picked at random, then the sample is a random sample.

b.  The distribution of life expectancies of European men in 2000 is normally distributed. Check:

(ref:expectancy-male8-density-cap) Density Plot of Life Expectancies of Males in Europe in 2000

```{r expectancy-male8-density, fig.cap="(ref:expactancy-male8-density-cap)", fig.alt="Density plot of life expectancy of a male. Looks skewed left"}
gf_density(~expect, data=Expectancy_male, title="Life Expectancy of a male")
```

(ref:expectancy-male8-qq-cap) Normal Quntile Plot of Life Expectancies of Males in Europe in 2000

```{r expectancy-male8-qq, fig.cap="(ref:expectancy-male8-qq-cap)", fig.alt="Normal quantile plot of life expectancy of a male. Does not looks linear."}
gf_qq(~expect, data=Expectancy_male, title="Male Life Expectancy")
```

 This sample does not appear to come from a population that is normally distributed. This sample is moderate to large, so it is good that the t-test is robust.

3.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval
 
 On R Studio, the command would be


```{r t-test8b}
t.test(~expect, data=Expectancy_male, conf.level=0.99)
```

 Sample statistic is 70.68 years, and the confidence interval is $68.60071<\mu<72.75778$. 

4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 99% confident that $68.60071<\mu<72.75778$ contains the mean life expectancy of European men.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean life expectancy of European men is between 68.60 and 72.76 years.
