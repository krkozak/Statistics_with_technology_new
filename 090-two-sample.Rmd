# Two-Sample Inference

Chapter 7 discussed methods of hypothesis testing about one-population parameters. Chapter 8 discussed methods of estimating population parameters from one sample using confidence intervals. This chapter will look at methods of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for two populations. Since there are two populations, there are two random variables, two means or proportions, and two samples (though with paired samples you usually consider there to be one sample with pairs collected). Examples of where you would do this are:

 Testing and estimating the difference in testosterone levels of men before and after they had children (Gettler, McDade, Feranil & Kuzawa, 2011).

 Testing the claim that a diet works by looking at the weight before and after subjects are on the diet.

 Estimating the difference in proportion of those who approve of President Obama in the age group 18 to 26 year old and the 55 and over age group.

All of these are examples of hypothesis tests or confidence intervals for two populations. The methods to conduct these hypothesis tests and confidence intervals will be explored in this chapter. As a reminder, all hypothesis tests are the same process. The only thing that changes is the formula that you use and the assumptions. Confidence intervals are also the same process, except that the formula is different.

## Two Proportions

There are times you want to test a claim about two population proportions or construct a confidence interval estimate of the difference between two population proportions. As with all other hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, the process is the same though the formulas and assumptions are different.

**Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportion (2-Prop Test)**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

 = number of successes from group 1

 = number of successes from group 2

 = proportion of successes in group 1

 = proportion of successes in group 2

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

 $H_o:p_1=p_2$

 $H_a: p_1\ne p_2$. the $\ne$ can be replaced with $<$ or $>$ depending on the question. 
 
 Also, state your $\alpha$ level here.

3.  State and check the assumptions for a hypothesis test

a.  A simple random sample of size $n_1$ is taken from population 1, and a simple random sample of size $n_2$ is taken from population 2.

b.  The samples are independent.

c.  The assumptions for the binomial distribution are satisfied for both populations.

d.  The sampling distribution of $\hat{p_1}$ can be approximated as a normal distribution. To determine the sampling distribution of $\hat{p_1}$, you need to show that $p_1*n_1\ge5$ and $q_1*n_1\ge5$ where $q_1=1-p_1$. If this requirement is true, then the sampling distribution of $\hat{p_1}$ is well approximated by a normal curve. The sampling distribution of $\hat{p_2}$ can be approximated as a normal distribution. To determine the sampling distribution of $\hat{p_2}$, you need to show that $p_2*n_2\ge 5$ and $q_2*n_2\ge 5$ where $q_2=1-p_2$. If this requirement is true, then the sampling distribution of $\hat{p_2}$ is well approximated by a normal curve. However, if you do not know $p_1$ and $p_2$, you will need to use $\hat{p_1}$ and $\hat{p_2}$ instead. This is not perfect, but it is the best you can do.

4.  Find the sample statistics, test statistic, and p-value

On R Studio, use the command 

```r
prop.test(c(x1,x2), c(n1, n2))
```

5.  Conclusion

 This is where you write reject or fail to reject$H_o$. The rule is: if the  p-value $<\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\ge \alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$.

6.  Interpretation

 This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.

**Confidence Interval for the Difference Between Two Population Proportion (2-Prop Interval)**

The confidence interval for the difference in proportions has the same random variables and proportions and the same assumptions as the hypothesis test for two proportions. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and proportions and state and check the assumptions before completing the confidence interval step.

1.  Find the sample statistics and the confidence interval

The confidence interval estimate of the difference is found using the following command in R Studio: 

```r
prop.test(c(x1,x2), c(n1, n2), conf.level=C as a decimal)
```

2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, "You are C% confident that the confidence interval contains the true difference in proportions."

3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state how much more (or less) the first proportion is from the second proportion.

### Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportions

Do husbands cheat on their wives in a different proportion from the proportion of wives cheat on their husbands (\"Statistics brain,\" 2013)? Suppose you take a group of 1000 randomly selected husbands and find that 231 had cheated on their wives. Suppose in a group of 1200 randomly selected wives, 176 cheated  on their husbands. Do the data show that the proportion of husbands who cheat on their wives is different from the proportion of wives who cheat on their husbands. Test at the 5% level.

 **Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

 $x_1$ = number of husbands who cheat on his wife

 $x_2$ = number of wives who cheat on her husband

 $p_1$ = proportion of husbands who cheat on his wife

 $p_2$ = proportion of wives who cheat on her husband

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

 $H_o: p_1=p_2$

 $H_a: p_1\ne p_2$

level of significance is $\alpha=0.05$

3.  State and check the assumptions for a hypothesis test

a.  A simple random sample of 1000 responses about cheating from husbands is taken. This was stated in the problem. A simple random sample of 1200 responses about cheating from wives is taken. Check: This was stated in the problem.

b.  The samples are independent. Check: The samples are independent. This is true since the samples involved different genders.

c.  The properties of the binomial distribution are satisfied in both populations. Check: This is true since there are only two responses, there are a fixed number of trials, the probability of a success is the same, and the trials are independent.

d.  The sampling distributions of $\hat{p_1}$ and $\hat{p_2}$ can be approximated with a normal distribution. Check: $n_1*p_1$, $n_2*p_2$, $n_1*q_1$, and $n_2*q_2$ are all greater than or equal to 5. So both sampling distributions of $\hat{p_1}$ and $\hat{p_2}$ can be approximated with a normal distribution.

4.  Find the sample statistics, test statistic, and p-value

 On R use the command:

```{r prop-test9}
prop.test(c(231,176), c(1000, 1200))
```

5.  Conclusion

 Reject $H_o$, since the p-value is less than 5%.

6.  Interpretation

This is enough evidence to support that the proportion of husbands having affairs is different from the proportion of wives having affairs.

### Example: Confidence Interval for Two Population Proportions

What is the difference in proportion that husbands cheat on their wives than wives cheat on the husbands (\"Statistics brain,\" 2013)? Suppose you take a group of 1000 randomly selected husbands and find that 231 had cheated on their wives. Suppose in a group of 1200 randomly selected wives, 176 cheated on their husbands. Estimate the difference in the proportion of husbands and wives who cheat on their spouses using a 95% confidence level.

 **Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

These were stated in example \#9.1.1.

2.  State and check the assumptions for the confidence interval

 The assumptions were stated and checked in example \#9.1.1.

3.  Find the sample statistics and the confidence interval

 On R use the command:

```{r prop-test9a}
prop.test(c(231,176), c(1000, 1200), conf.level = .95)
```

4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that $0.05050705<p_1-p_2<0.11815962$ contains the true difference in proportions.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The proportion of husbands who cheat on their wives is anywhere from 5.05% to 11.82% higher than the proportion of wives who cheat on their husband.

### Homework

## Paired Samples for Two Means

Are two populations the same? Is the average height of men taller than the average height of women? Is the mean weight less after a diet than before?

You can compare populations by comparing their means. You take a sample from each population and compare the statistics.

Anytime you compare two populations you need to know if the samples are independent or dependent. The formulas you use are different for different types of samples.

If how you choose one sample has no effect on the way you choose the other sample, the two samples are **independent.** The way to think about it is that in independent samples, the individuals from one sample are overall different from the units of observations from the other sample. This will mean that sample one has no affect on sample two. The sample values from one sample are not related or paired with values from the other sample.

If you choose the samples so that a measurement in one sample is paired with a measurement from the other sample, the samples are **dependent** or **matched** or **paired**. (Often a before and after situation.) You want to make sure the there is a meaning for pairing data values from one sample with a specific data value from the other sample. One way to think about it is that in dependent samples, the units of observations from one sample are the same units of observations from the other sample, though there can be other reasons to pair values. This makes the sample values from each sample paired.

In tidy data, remember each row is a unit of measurement, and each column is a variable. In paired samples, you would have two variables that you are working with. In independent samples, you would have a variable that distinguishes a unit of observation from another unit of observation. As an example, in the Pulse data frame, consider the variables pulse_before and pulse_after. Since they are measured off the same unit of observation, then comparing the two variables would be a paired samples analysis. However, consider the pulse_after and whether a person smokes would be comparing the variable pulse_after against the variable smokes to see if smoking effects a person's pulse rate after exercise. In this case, the units of observations would be different based on smoking yes or smoking no. Consider the variable smoking to be the factor that one is interested in seeing how it effects pulse rate. 

**Table \#9.2.1: Data frame Pulse**

```{r pulse9-data, warning=FALSE}
Pulse<-read.csv(
  "https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/pulse.csv")
head(Pulse)
```

### Example: Independent or Dependent Samples

Determine if the following are dependent or independent samples.

a.  Randomly choose 5 men and 6 women and compare their heights

 **Solution:**

 Independent, since there is no reason that one value belongs to another. The units of observations are not the same for both samples. The units of observations are definitely different. A way to think about this is that the knowledge that a man is chosen in one sample does not give any information about any of the woman chosen in the other sample.

b.  Choose 10 men and weigh them. Give them a new diet drug and later weigh them again.

 **Solution:**

 Dependent, since each person's before weight can be matched with their after weight. The units of observations are the same for both samples. A way to think about this is that the knowledge that a person weighs 400 pounds at the beginning will tell you something about their weight after the diet drug.

c.  Take 10 people and measure the strength of their dominant arm and their non-dominant arm.

 **Solution:**
 Dependent, since you can match the two arm strengths. The units of observations are the same for both samples. So the knowledge of one person's dominant arm strength will tell you something about the strength of their non-dominant arm.

To analyze data when there are matched or paired samples, called dependent samples, you conduct a paired t-test. Since the samples are matched, you can find the difference between the values of the two random variables.

**Hypothesis Test for Two Sample Paired t-Test**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

$x_1$ = random variable 1

$x_2$ = random variable 2

$\mu_1$ = mean of random variable 1

$\mu_2$ = mean of random variable 2

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

 The hypotheses would be

$H_o:\mu_1=\mu_2$ or$H_o:\mu_1-\mu_2=0$

$H_a:\mu_1\ne \mu_2$ or $H_a:\mu_1-\mu_2\ne0$

 However, since you are finding the differences, then you can actually think of $\mu_1-\mu_2=\mu_d$.

 So the hypotheses could become

$H_o:\mu_d=0$

$H_a:\mu_d\ne 0$ Remember, you can replace $\ne$ with $<$ or $>$.

 Also, state your $\alpha$ level here.

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

a.  A random sample of *n* pairs is taken.

b.  The population of the difference between random variables is normally distributed. In this case the population you are interested in has to do with the differences that you find. It does not matter if each random variable is normally distributed. It is only important if the differences you find are normally distributed. Just as before, the t-test is fairly robust to the assumption if the sample size is large. This means that if this assumption isn't met, but your sample size is quite large, then the results of the t-test are valid.

4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value

Realize that a paired test is a one sample t-test on the difference between two variables. So you are running a one-sample t-test on a new variable known as the difference variable. You need to create this difference variable by creating a new data frame. This is done on R Studio by doing the following command (The following shows how to create the variable difference for pulse_after-pulse_before on the data frame Pulse. Change the variables used and data frame used to your data frame and variables):

**Table \#9.2.2: Data frame Pulse with Difference**

```{r pulse9-new-data, warning=FALSE}
Pulse<-read.csv(
  "https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/pulse.csv")
Pulse_new<-Pulse%>%
  mutate(difference=pulse_after-pulse_before)
head(Pulse_new)
```
Notice R Studio created a new data frame called Pulse_new and that data frame has the variable difference.
Now to conduct a paired t-test use the R Studio command 

```r
t.test(~difference variable, data=New Data Frame)
```

Note: if the $H_a$ is <, then the command becomes 

```r
t.test(~difference variable, data=New Data Frame, alternative="less")
```

Similarly for > put alternative="greater"

5.  Conclusion

 This is where you write reject $H_o$ or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\ge\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$.

6.  Interpretation

 This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.

**Confidence Interval for Difference in Means from Paired Samples (t-Interval)**

The confidence interval for the difference in means has the same random variables and means and the same assumptions as the hypothesis test for two paired samples. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and means, and state and check the assumptions before completing the confidence interval step.

1.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval
Again, you will need to create a new data frame with a difference variable. Then on R Studio the command is 

```r
t.test(~difference variable, data=Data Frame, conf.level=C as a decimal)
```

2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, "You are C% confident that the statement contains the true mean difference."

3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval contains the true mean difference.

**How to check the assumptions of t-test and confidence interval:**

In order for the t-test or confidence interval to be valid, the assumptions of the test must be met. So whenever you run a t-test or confidence interval, you must make sure the assumptions are met. So you need to check them. Here is how you do this:

1.  For the assumption that the sample is a random sample, describe how you took the samples. Make sure your sampling technique is random and that the samples were dependent.

2.  For the assumption that the population of the differences is normal, remember the process of assessing normality from chapter 6. Make sure you use the difference variable that was created in the new data frame.

### Example: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples

Is the pulse rate after exercise different from the pulse rate before exercise for a woman who drinks alcohol? Use the data frame Pulse (table \#9.2.3). Test at the 5% level.

**Table \#9.2.3: Data frame Pulse**

```{r pulse9c-data, warning=FALSE}
Pulse<-read.csv(
  "https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/pulse.csv")
head(Pulse)
```

**Code book for data frame Pulse** See problem \#3.2.5 in section 3.2.

**Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

 $x_1$ = pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol after exercise

 $x_1$ = pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol before exercise

 $\mu_1$ = mean pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol after exercise

 $\mu_1$ = mean pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol after exercise

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

 $H_o: \mu_1=\mu_2$

$H_a: \mu_1\ne \mu_2$

level of significance, $\alpha=0.05$

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

a.  A random sample of 110 pairs of pulse rates after and before exercise was taken. Check: The data frame says that the data was collected from students in classes for several years. Though this was not a random sample, it is probably a representative sample.

b.  The population of the difference in after and before pulse rates is normally distributed. Check: To see if this is true, look at the density plot and the normal quantile plot for the difference between after and before. This variable must be created before the density plot and normal quantile plot can be created. The other thing is that a new data frame must be created for females drink alcohol. 

**Table \#9.2.4: Data frame Pulse of Females Who Drink Alcohol**

```{r pulse9-female-data}
Pulse_female<-
Pulse%>%
filter(gender=="female", alcohol=="yes")
head(Pulse_female)
```

Now mutate the Pulse_female data frame to include a difference variable

**Table \#9.2.5: Data frame Pulse of Females Who Drink Alcohol with Difference**

```{r pulse9-female-new-data}
Pulse_female_new<-Pulse_female%>%
  mutate(difference=pulse_after-pulse_before)
head(Pulse_female_new)
```

Now create a density plot and normal quantile plot on the difference variable.

(ref:pulse9-female-density-cap) Density Plot of Differences in pulse rates

```{r pulse9-female-density, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:pulse9-female-density-cap)", fig.alt="Density plot of differences in pulse rates. Looks skewed right", warning=FALSE}
gf_density(~difference, data=Pulse_female_new, titl="Difference in pulse rates")
```


(ref:pulse9-female-qq-cap) Normal Quantile Plot of Differences in Weights

```{r pulse9-female-qq, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:pulse9-female-qq-cap)", fig.alt="Normal quantile plot of differences in pulse rates. Doe snot looks linear"}
gf_qq(~difference, data=Pulse_female_new)
```


 The density plot is not symmetrical and the normal quantile plot on the differences is not linear.
So you cannot assume that the distribution of the difference in pulse rates is normal. It is good that the t-test is robust if there is a large sample. The sample is of size 110, so that should be adequate to assume the conclusion is valid.

4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value
 On R Studio, use the command:

```{r pulse9-female-new-ttest)}
t.test(~difference, data=Pulse_female_new)
```

5.  Conclusion

 Since the p-value < 0.05, reject $H_o$.

6.  Interpretation

 There is enough evidence to support that there is a difference in pulse rate before and after exercise of females who smoke.

### Example: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples

The New Zealand Air Force purchased a batch of flight helmets. They then found out that the helmets didn't fit. In order to make sure that they order the correct size helmets, they measured the head size of recruits. To save money, they wanted to use cardboard calipers, but were not sure if they will be accurate enough. So they took 18 recruits and measured their heads with the cardboard calipers and also with metal calipers. The data frame is in table \#9.2.6 (Helmet Sizes for New Zealand Airforce, 2019). Do the data provide enough evidence to show that there is a difference in measurements between the cardboard and metal calipers? Use a 5% level of significance.

**Table \#9.2.6: Data for Head Measurements**

```{r helmet9-data}
Helmet<-read.csv(
  "https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/helmet.csv")
head(Helmet)
```
**Code book for data frame Helmet**

**Description**
After purchasing a batch of flight helmets that did not fit the heads of many pilots, the NZ Airforce decided to measure the head sizes of all recruits. Before this was carried out, information was collected to determine the feasibility of using cheap cardboard calipers to make the measurements, instead of metal ones which were expensive and uncomfortable. The data lists the head diameters of 18 recruits measured once using cardboard calipers and again using metal calipers. One question is whether there is any systematic difference between the two sets of calipers. One might also ask whether there is more variability in the cardboard calipers measurement than that of the metal calipers.

This data frame contains the following columns:

Cardboard: measurement using cardboard calipers (cm)

Metal: measurement using metal calipers (cm)

**References**
Data courtesy of Dr Stephen Legg. Seber and Lee (1998). Page 545.

**Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

 $x_1$ = head measurement of recruit using cardboard caliper

 $x_2$ = head measurement of recruit using metal caliper

 $\mu_1$= mean head measurement of recruit using cardboard caliper

 $\mu_2$ = mean head measurement of recruit using metal caliper

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

$H_o:\mu_1=\mu_2$

$H_a:\mu_1\ne \mu_2$

level of significance, $\alpha=0.05$

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

a.  A random sample of 18 pairs of head measures of recruits with cardboard and metal caliper was taken. Check: This was not stated, but probably could be safely assumed. 

b.  The population of the difference in head measurements between cardboard and metal calipers is normally distributed. Check: First create the difference variable, then the density plot and normal quantile plot.

 **Table \#9.2.7: Data for Head Measurements with Difference Variable**

```{r helmet9a-data}
Helmet_new<-Helmet%>%
  mutate(difference=Cardboard-Metal)
head(Helmet_new)
```

(ref:helmet9-new-density-cap) Desnity Plot of Differences in Head Measurements

```{r helmet9-new-denstiy, fig.cap="(ref:helmet9-new-density-cap)", fig.alt="Density plot of differences in head measurements"}
gf_density(~difference, data=Helmet_new, title="Differences in Head Measurements")
```

(ref:helmet9-new-qq-cap) Normal Quantile Plot of Differences in Head Measurements

```{r helmet9-new-qq, fig.cap="(ref:helmet9-new-qq-cap)", fig.alt="Normal quantile plot of differences in head measurements"}
gf_qq(~difference, data=Helmet_new, title="Differences in Head Measurements")
```

 This density plot looks somewhat bell shaped. The normal quantile plot on the differences looks somewhat linear. So you can assume that the distribution of the difference in weights is normal.

4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value

 Using R Studio the command is 

```{r helmet9-ttest}
t.test(~difference, data=Helmet_new)
```

 The sample statistic is 1.6111, the test statistic is 3.1854, and the p-value is 0.005415.

5.  Conclusion

 Since the p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_o$.

6.  Interpretation

 There is enough evidence to support that the mean head measurements using the cardboard calipers are not the same as when using the metal calipers. So it looks like the New Zealand Air Force shouldn't use the cardboard calipers.

```{r helmet9-confinterval}
t.test(~difference, data=Helmet_new, conf.leve=0.95)
```

4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confidence that $0.5440163<\mu_1-\mu_2<2.6782060$ contains the true mean difference in head measurement between using the cardboard and metal calibers.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean head measurement using the cardboard calibers is anywhere from 0.54 cm to 2.68 cm more than the head measurement using the metal calibers. 

Examples \#9.2.2 and \#9.2.4 use the same data set, but one is conducting a hypothesis test and the other is conducting a confidence interval. Notice that the hypothesis test's conclusion was to reject and say that there was a difference in the means, and the confidence interval does not contain the number 0. If the confidence interval did contain the number 0, then that would mean that the two means could be the same. Since the interval did not contain 0, then you could say that the means are different just as in the hypothesis test. This means that the hypothesis test and the confidence interval can produce the same interpretation. Do be careful though, you can run a hypothesis test with a particular significance level and a confidence interval with a confidence level that is not compatible with your significance level. This will mean that the conclusion from the confidence interval would not be the same as with a hypothesis test. So if you want to estimate the mean difference, then conduct a confidence interval. If you want to show that the means are different, then conduct a hypothesis test. As a reminder, the American Statistical Association (ASA) suggests not conducting hypothesis tests and just create confidence intervals. 

### Homework

**Description**
This file consists of three separate data sets, all of which address the issues of how superstitions regarding Friday the 13th affect human behavior, and whether Friday the 13th is an unlucky day. Scanlon, et al. collected data on traffic and shopping patterns and accident frequency for Fridays the 6th and 13th between October of 1989 and November of 1992.

For the first data set, the researchers obtained information from the British Department of Transport regarding the traffic flows between junctions 7 to 8 and junctions 9 to 10 of the M25 motorway. They collected the numbers of shoppers in nine different supermarkets in southeast England for the second data set. The third data set contains numbers of emergency admissions to hospitals due to transport accidents.

We present the three data sets in a combined format, with the variable "Data set" as an identifier that may be used to separate them.

 This data frame contains the following columns:

 source: which data set the data were obtained from

year: which year the data was collected from

Month: the month that the Friday was in

x6th: Number of cars passing through junction (traffic data set), shoppers for each supermarket (shopping data set), or admissions due to transport accidents (accident data set) on Friday the 6th

x13th: Number of cars passing through junction (traffic data set), shoppers for each supermarket (shopping data set), or admissions due to transport accidents (accident data set) on Friday the 13th

location: Motorway junction (traffic data set), supermarket location (shopping data set) or hospital (accident data set) to which the data correspond

## Independent Samples for Two Means

This section will look at how to analyze when two samples are collected that are independent. As with all other hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, the process is the same though the formulas and assumptions are different.

**Hypothesis Test for Independent t-Test (2-Sample t-Test)**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

 $x_1$ = random variable 1

 $x_2$= random variable 2

 $\mu_1$= mean of random variable 1

 $\mu_2$= mean of random variable 2

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

 The hypotheses would be

 $H_o:\mu_1=\mu_2$

 $H_a:\mu_1\ne \mu_2$, the $\ne$ can be replaced with $<$ or $>$

 Also, state your $\alpha$ level here.


3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

a.  A random sample of size $n_1$ is taken from population 1. A random sample of size $n_2$ is taken from population 2. Note: the samples do not need to be the same size, but the test is more robust if they are.

b.  The two samples are independent.

c.  Population 1 is normally distributed. Population 2 is normally distributed. Just as before, the t-test is fairly robust to the assumption if the sample size is large. This means that if this assumption isn't met, but your sample sizes are quite large, then the results of the t-test are valid.

d.  The population variances are unknown and not assumed to be equal. The old assumption is that the variances are equal. However, this assumption is no longer an assumption that most statisticians use. This is because it isn't really realistic to assume that the variances are equal. So just assume the assumption of the variances being unknown and not assumed to be equal is true, and it will not be checked.

4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value

The command using R is 

```r
t.test(variable~factor, data=Data Frame)
```


Note: if the $H_a$ is <, then the command becomes 

```r
t.test(variable~factor, data=Data Frame, alternative="less")
```

Similarly for > put alternative="greater"

5.  Conclusion

This is where you write reject or fail to reject . The rule is: if the p-value $<\alpha$ , then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\ge \alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$.

6.  Interpretation

This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.

**Confidence Interval for the Difference in Means from Two Independent Samples (2 Samp T-Int)**

The confidence interval for the difference in means has the same random variables and means and the same assumptions as the hypothesis test for independent samples. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and means and state and check the assumptions before completing the confidence interval step.

Find the sample statistic and confidence interval

On R Studio, the command is 

```r
t.test(variable~factor, data=Data Frame, conf.level=C as a decimal)
```


2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, "You are C% confident that the interval contains the true mean difference."

3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval contains the true difference in means, though often you state how much more (or less) the first mean is from the second mean.

**How to check the assumptions of two sample t-test and confidence interval:**

In order for the t-test or confidence interval to be valid, the assumptions of the test must be valid So whenever you run a t-test or confidence interval, you must make sure the assumptions are valid So you need to check them. Here is how you do this:

1.  For the random sample assumption, describe how you took the two samples. Make sure your sampling technique is random for both samples.

2.  For the independent assumption, describe how they are independent samples.

3.  For the assumption about each population being normally distributed, remember the process of assessing normality from chapter 6. Make sure you assess each sample separately.

4.  You do not need to check the variance assumption since it is being assumed.

### Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Means

The cholesterol level of people vary for many reasons. The question is do people with diabetes have different cholesterol levels from people who do not have diabetes? Use the NHANES data frame. Test at the 5% level.

 **Table \#9.3.1: NHANES Data Frame**

```{r NHANES9-names}
names(NHANES) #displays the names of the variables in a data frame
```
**Code book for data frame NHANES** type help("NHANES") in the R Console.

 **Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

 $x_1$ = Cholesterol level of people with diabetes

 $x_2$ = Cholesterol level of people without diabetes

 $\mu_1$ = mean cholesterol level of people with diabetes

 $\mu_2$ = mean cholesterol level of people without diabetes

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

The hypotheses would be

$H_o: \mu_1=\mu_2$

$H_a: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$

level of significance, $\alpha=0.05$

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

a.  A random sample of cholesterol levels of people with diabetes is taken. A random sample of cholesterol levels of people without diabetes is taken. Check: The NHANES data frame uses cluster sampling which incorporates random sampling, so the sample is probably representative. This assumption has been met.

b.  The two samples are independent. Check: This is because either they were dealing with people who have diabetes or not.

c.  Population of all cholesterol levels of people who have diabetes is normally distributed. Population of all cholesterol levels of people without diabetes is normally distributed.
Check:

(ref:NHANES9-diabetes-density-cap) Density Plot of Cholesterol levels of people with and without Diabetes:


```{r NHANES9-diabetes-density, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:NHANES9-diabetes-density-cap)", fig.alt="Density plot of total coholesterol faceted by diabetes. Looks somehwat bell shaped."}
NHANES_no_NA<-
  NHANES %>% 
  drop_na(Diabetes)
gf_density(~TotChol|Diabetes, data=NHANES_no_NA)
```


Both the yes group and the no group look somewhat bell shaped.
  
(ref:NHANES9-diabetes-qq-cap) Normal Quantile Plot of Cholesterol Levels of people with and without Diabetes

```{r NHANES9-diabetes-qq, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:NHANES9-diabetes-qq-cap)", fig.alt="Normal quantile plot of total coholesterol faceted by diabetes. Looks somehwat linear."}
gf_qq(~TotChol|Diabetes, data=NHANES_no_NA)
```

Both the yes group and the no group look somewhat linear.

The population of all cholesterol levels of people who have diabetes is probably normally distributed.  The population of all cholesterol levels of people who do not have diabetes is probably normally distributed.

4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value

The variable is cholesterol (TotChol) and separating based on if a person has diabetes or not. So the factor is Diabetes. Using R Studio the command would be

```{r NHANES9b-ttest}
t.test(TotChol~Diabetes, data=NHANES)
```

5.  Conclusion 

Reject $H_o$ since the p-value $<\alpha$.

6.  Interpretation

This is enough evidence to support that people who have diabetes have different cholesterol levels on average from people who do not have diabetes.

### Example: Confidence Interval in Two Samples

The cholesterol level of people vary for many reasons. The question is how different is the cholesterol levels of people with diabetes from people who do not have diabetes? Use the NHANES data frame. Compute a 95% confidence interval.

 **Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

These were stated in example \#9.3.1

2.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

The assumptions were stated and checked in example \#9.3.1.

3.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval

The variable is cholesterol (TotChol) and separating based on if a person has diabetes or not. So the factor is Diabetes. Using R Studio the command would be

```{r NHANES9-confinterval}
t.test(TotChol~Diabetes, data=NHANES, conf.level=0.95)
```

4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that the interval $0.02105115<\mu_1-\mu_2<0.19851114$ contains the true difference in means.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean cholesterol level for people with diabetes is anywhere from 0.021 mmol/L to 0.199 mmol/L more than the mean cholesterol level for people without diabetes. 


### Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Means

The amount of sodium in beef and poultry hot dogs was measured. (\"SOCR 012708 id,\" 2013). The data is in table \#9.3.2. Is there enough evidence to show that beef has different amounts of sodium on average than poultry hot dogs? Use a 5% level of significance.

 **Table \#9.3.2: Hotdog Data**

```{r hotdog9a-data, warning=FALSE}
Hotdog<-read.csv(
  "https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/hotdog_beef_poultry.csv")
head(Hotdog)
```
**Code book for data frame Hotdog** 

**Description**
Results of a laboratory analysis of calories and sodium content of major hot dog brands. Researchers for Consumer Reports analyzed three types of hot dog: beef, poultry, and meat (mostly pork and beef, but up to 15% poultry meat). The meat was left off this data frame so a two-sample t-test could be performed.

This data frame contains the following columns:

type: Type of hot dog (beef or poultry)

calories: Calories per hot dog

sodium: Milligrams of sodium per hot dog

**References**
SOCR Home page: http://www.socr.ucla.edu

 **Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

 $x_1$ = sodium level in beef hotdogs

 $x_2$ = sodium level in poultry hotdogs

 $\mu_1$ = mean sodium level in beef hotdogs

 $\mu_2$ = mean sodium level in poultry hotdogs

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of
    significance

 The hypotheses would be

 $H_o:\mu_1=\mu_2$

 $H_o:\mu_1\ne \mu_2$

 level of significance: $\alpha=0.05$

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

a.  A random sample of 20 sodium levels in beef hotdogs is taken. A random sample of 20 sodium levels in poultry hotdogs. Check: The code does not state if either sample was randomly selected, but since Consumer Reports performed the test, it is safe to assume the samples were both random.

b.  The two samples are independent. Check: These are different types of hotdogs so this is true.

c.  Population of all sodium levels in beef hotdogs is normally distributed. Population of all sodium levels in poultry hotdogs is normally distributed. Check:

(ref:hotdog9-density-cap) Density Plot of Sodium Levels in Hotdogs

```{r hotdog9-density, fig.cap="(ref:hotdog9-desnity-cap)", fig.alt="Density plot of sodium amount faceted by type. Neither  looks bell shaped."}
gf_density(~sodium|type, data=Hotdog)
```

The density plot for beef hotdogs looks somewhat bell shaped, but the density plot for poultry hotdogs does not look bell shaped.

(ref:hotdog9-qq-cap) Normal Quantile Plot of Sodium Levels in Hotdogs

```{r hotdog9-qq, fig.cap="(ref:hotdog9-qq-cap)", fig.alt="Normal quantile plot of sodium amount faceted by type. The beef graph looks linear, but the poultry doesn't."}
gf_qq(~sodium|type, data=Hotdog)
```

The normal quantile plot for the sodium level in beef hotdogs looks somewhat linear. The normal quantile plot for the sodium level in poultry hotdogs does not look linear. The population of all sodium levels in beef hotdogs may be normally distributed, but the population of all sodium levels in poultry hotdogs is probably not normally distributed. The sample size is not very large so the results of the test may not be valid. A larger sample would be a good idea.

4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value

Using R Studio the variable is sodium levels (sodium) in different types of hot dogs. So the factor is type. The command is

```{r hotdog9-ttest}
t.test(sodium~type, data=Hotdog)
```

5.  Conclusion: Fail to reject $H_o$ since the p-value $\ge \alpha$.

6.  Interpretation

 This is not enough evidence to support that beef hotdogs' sodium level is different from poultry hotdogs. (Though do realize that the population assumptions is not valid, so this interpretation may be invalid.)

### Example: Confidence Interval for Two Independent Samples

The amount of sodium in beef and poultry hotdogs was measured. (\"SOCR 012708 id,\" 2013). The data is in table \#9.3.2. Find a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in sodium levels between beef and poultry hotdogs.

 **Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

    These were stated in example \#9.3.3.

2.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

 The assumptions were stated and checked in example \#9.3.3.

3.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval
Using R Studio the variable is sodium levels (sodium) in different types of hot dogs. So the factor is type. The command is

```{r hotdog9-confinterval}
t.test(sodium~type, data=Hotdog, conf.level=0.95)
```

4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that the interval $-120.325706<\mu_1-\mu_2<4.625706$ contains the true difference in mean sodium level between beef and poultry hot dogs.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean sodium level of beef hotdogs is anywhere from 120.33 mg less than the mean sodium level of poultry hotdogs to 4.63 mg more. (The negative sign on the lower limit implies that the first mean is less than the second mean. The positive sign on the upper limit implies that the first mean is greater than the second mean.)

Do realize that the population assumptions is not valid, so this interpretation may be invalid.

### Homework

A random sample was taken from the group that was given the shot using conventional methods, and a random sample was taken from the group that was given the shot where the mother held the infant prior to and during the shot.

This data frame contains the following columns:

method: whether the infant was given the conventional method (convent) or the new method (new) prior to being given the vitamin K shot.

crying: how long the infant cried after given a vitamin K shot. (seconds)

8. A vitamin K shot is given to infants soon after birth. Nurses at Northbay Healthcare were involved in a study to see if how they handle the infants could reduce the pain the infants feel (\"SOCR data nips,\" 2013). The data frame is in table \#9.3.6. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in mean crying time after being given a vitamin K shot between infants held using conventional methods and infants held by their mothers.

## Which Analysis Should You Conduct?

One of the most important concept that you need to understand is deciding which analysis you should conduct for a particular situation. To help you to figure out the analysis to conduct, there are a series of questions you should ask yourself.

1.  Does the problem deal with mean or proportion?

Sometimes the problem states explicitly the words mean or proportion, but other times you have to figure it out based on the information you are given. If you counted number of individuals that responded in the affirmative to a question, then you are dealing with proportion. If you measured something, then you are dealing with mean.

2.  Does the problem have one or two samples?

So look to see if one group was measured or if two groups were measured. You need to decide if the problem describes collecting data from one group or from two groups, or if you are comparing two different groups.

3.  If you have two samples, then you need to determine if the samples are independent or dependent.

If the individuals are different for both samples, then most likely the samples are independent. If you can't tell, then determine if a data value from the first sample influences the data value in the second sample. In other words, can you pair data values together so you can find the difference, and that difference has meaning. If the answer is yes, then the samples are paired. Otherwise, the samples are independent.

4.  Does the situation involve a hypothesis test or a confidence interval?

If the problem talks about "do the data show", "is there evidence of", "test to see", then you are doing a hypothesis test. If the problem talks about "find the value", "estimate the" or "find  the interval", then you are doing a confidence interval.

So if you have a situation that has two samples, independent samples, involving the mean, and is a hypothesis test, then you have a two-sample independent t-test. Now you look up the assumptions and the technology process for doing this test. Every hypothesis test involves the same six steps, and you just have to use the correct assumptions and calculations. Every confidence interval has the same five steps, and again you just need to use the correct assumptions and calculations. So this is why it is so important to figure out what analysis you should conduct.
